# Dissertation
In this repo I will store all the documents, data, and analyses for my PhD dissertation. Namely, all of the data files and
RMarkdown documents split into folders by study. Additionally, I will include pre-registration documents and links to the OSF
(Open Science Framework) pages that contain the original time stamped pre-registrations.
